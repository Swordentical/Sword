Got it — you want a **clean, copy-pasteable Cursor AI prompt** that explains the goal without over-specifying implementation. Here’s a strong version that Cursor will understand and act on, followed by a slightly stricter variant in case it gets hand-wavy.

---

### **Primary Cursor AI Prompt (recommended)**

> I have an existing web application for organizing clinic information. I won’t go into how the app currently works internally.
>
> I want you to update the existing database schema and application logic so that the app supports **multiple clinics**, where data is fully isolated per clinic.
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Each clinic should have its own logical database or data partition.
> * Users (doctors/staff) must belong to exactly one clinic.
> * Add a `clinic_id` (or equivalent) relationship to the user model.
> * One clinic can have many users/doctors.
> * All clinic-specific data must be associated with a clinic.
>
> Access rules:
>
> * Users can only read and write data that belongs to their own clinic.
> * Doctors in the same clinic should see the same shared clinic data.
> * Doctors from different clinics must not be able to access or query each other’s data.
>
> Tasks:
>
> * Propose and implement the necessary database schema changes.
> * Update existing queries, models, and relationships to enforce clinic isolation.
> * Ensure authorization checks are applied consistently so clinic boundaries are enforced at the application level.
>
> Do not rewrite unrelated parts of the app. Focus only on schema changes, data relationships, and access control needed to support multi-clinic isolation.

### **Stricter / More Opinionated Variant (if Cursor needs guardrails)**

> Modify the existing app to support **multi-tenant clinic isolation**.
>
> Treat each clinic as a tenant. Add a `clinics` table/model and associate all users and clinic-owned data with a `clinic_id`.
>
> Enforce the following:
>
> * A user belongs to one clinic.
> * A clinic has many users.
> * All clinic data is filtered by `clinic_id`.
> * No cross-clinic data access is possible, even accidentally.
>
> Update:
>
> * Database schema
> * ORM models
> * Queries
> * Authorization logic
>
> Assume the app already works for a single clinic and you are generalizing it to support multiple clinics safely.

### **Quick tip**

If your stack is something like **Prisma / Rails / Django / Supabase / Postgres**, you can add one line at the top like:

> The app uses **[STACK NAME HERE]**.

That helps Cursor choose the *right* patterns instead of guessing.

If you want, tell me:

* your backend framework
* your ORM (if any)
* whether you want **separate physical databases** vs **shared DB with clinic_id**

…and I’ll tighten this prompt even more 🔧✨
