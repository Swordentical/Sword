Replit Prompt — Theme Transition That MORPHS Content (NO COVER OVERLAY)
⚠️ Problem to Fix

The current animation behaves like:

A dark layer covers the UI → disappears

This feels artificial.

We want:

The UI itself transitions, not something placed on top of it.

🎯 Objective

Replace the “covering overlay” effect with a content-aware theme morph where:

Backgrounds

Cards

Sidebar

Text

Borders

transition naturally, as if the theme itself is transforming.

🧠 Key Concept (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ WRONG

Full-screen overlay with opacity

Mask that hides content

Black layer covering everything

✅ RIGHT

Animate CSS variables

Animate backgrounds, colors, shadows

Use clip-path / mask ONLY as a catalyst, not a cover

🧱 Correct Architecture
1️⃣ Theme Driven by CSS Variables (MANDATORY)

All theme colors must come from variables:

:root {
  --bg: #ffffff;
  --card: #f8f9fa;
  --fg: #111111;
  --border: #e5e7eb;
}

.dark {
  --bg: #0b0f14;
  --card: #121826;
  --fg: #e5e7eb;
  --border: #1f2937;
}


Components use:

background-color: var(--bg);
color: var(--fg);

2️⃣ Transition Happens INSIDE the Page

Instead of an overlay:

Animate:

background-color

color

box-shadow

border-color

Add a radial gradient spotlight that subtly accelerates the transition

Example:

body {
  transition:
    background-color 700ms ease-in-out,
    color 700ms ease-in-out;
}

🌊 Advanced Effect (THE GOOD PART)
Radial Theme Diffusion (Not a Cover)

Use a pseudo-element on body or #app

It does NOT hide content

It only influences background blending

body::before {
  content: '';
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  background: radial-gradient(
    circle at var(--theme-x) var(--theme-y),
    rgba(0,0,0,0.25),
    transparent 60%
  );
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0;
}


On toggle:

Set --theme-x / --theme-y from switch position

Animate opacity briefly

Fade it out while colors transition underneath

👉 Result:
Darkness feels like it spreads — but content is always visible

🎞️ Timing & Motion Rules

Color transitions: 600–800ms

Gradient influence: 300–400ms

Slight stagger:

Background first

Cards after (~50ms)

Text last (~80ms)

NO flash. NO cover. NO disappearance.

🧪 UX Constraints

User must always see content

No moment where UI is hidden

No “wipe” or “curtain” feeling

Respect prefers-reduced-motion

🚫 Explicitly Forbidden

❌ Full opacity overlays

❌ z-index: 9999 cover layers

❌ Mask that hides text

❌ Fade-to-black screen

❌ Replacing theme instantly after animation

✅ Acceptance Criteria

This is correct ONLY IF:

UI elements are visible at all times

Theme feels like it morphs

No layer feels “on top”

The animation feels ambient, not theatrical

🧠 Design Philosophy

Good UI transitions don’t hide content.
They persuade it to change.
