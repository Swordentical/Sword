Replit Prompt — Cinematic Dark Mode Transition (Sun → Moon)
🎯 Objective

Create a modern, premium dark mode switch with a smooth, immersive transition, not a basic on/off toggle.

The transition should feel like:

The sun sets → darkness spreads → the moon rises

This should enhance user experience emotionally, not just functionally.

🎨 Design & Interaction Requirements
Switch Design

Custom-designed toggle (NOT default switch)

Visual elements:

Sun icon (light mode)

Moon icon (dark mode)

Subtle glow on active state

Micro-animations (scale, rotation, glow)

🌊 Transition Behavior (CRITICAL)

When user toggles theme:

1️⃣ The animation starts from the switch position

Use a radial or expanding mask

The color transition spreads outward from the switch

Feels like light fading or darkness expanding

2️⃣ Screen fill animation

Light → Dark:

Warm colors fade

Darkness fills the screen smoothly

Dark → Light:

Soft light expands

Shadows retreat

3️⃣ Sun ↔ Moon animation

Sun:

Shrinks + fades

Rotates slightly

Moon:

Gently rises

Slight glow

Smooth easing (no sharp motion)

🎞️ Motion Rules

Use ease-in-out cubic / spring animation

Duration: ~500–700ms (not instant)

No flashing

No harsh color jumps

No layout shifts

🧠 UX Principles

Animation must feel natural and calm

Should feel “premium SaaS / Apple-level”

No distraction after animation ends

Must respect prefers-reduced-motion

🛠️ Technical Requirements
Stack

React 18

Tailwind CSS

CSS variables for theme colors

Optional: Framer Motion (recommended)

Theme Handling

Use CSS variables:

--bg
--fg
--card
--border
--accent


Persist theme in:

localStorage

Sync with system preference on first load

🧪 Edge Cases

Page reload preserves theme

Works on mobile & desktop

Works inside modal/dialog

Animation does not replay on every route change

🚫 Avoid

❌ Basic checkbox toggle

❌ Instant background color switch

❌ Overly long animation

❌ Gimmicky effects

❌ Re-render flicker

🌙 Inspiration Keywords (DO NOT COPY, JUST FEEL)

“Material You”

“Apple macOS theme transitions”

“Cinematic UI”

“Ambient interface”

“Calm technology”

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Dark mode is considered DONE only if:

Transition feels smooth and intentional

User instantly understands what happened

The switch feels delightful, not technical

It looks unique (not template-like)

🧠 Philosophy

Dark mode is not a feature.
It’s a mood.

Build it accordingly.
