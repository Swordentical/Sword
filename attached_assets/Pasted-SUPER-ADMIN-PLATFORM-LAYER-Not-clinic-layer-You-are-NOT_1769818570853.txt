SUPER ADMIN = PLATFORM LAYER (Not clinic layer)

You are NOT:

a clinic

a doctor

a lab

You are:

System Operator

So when SUPER ADMIN mode is activated, the app is literally switching layers.

🧠 Big Architecture Idea

You now have:

LAYER 1 → Tenant Layer (Clinics, Labs, Radiology)
LAYER 2 → Platform Layer (Super Admin)


Completely different purpose.
Same codebase. Different universe.

🎯 UI Behavior (VERY IMPORTANT)

You said:

Button in sidebar: SUPER ADMIN

Correct. But it must:

⚠️ Visually feel like leaving the clinic world

When clicked:

Sidebar changes

Color accent slightly changes (to indicate platform mode)

New navigation structure

No patient-facing stuff

This is a control tower, not a clinic.
