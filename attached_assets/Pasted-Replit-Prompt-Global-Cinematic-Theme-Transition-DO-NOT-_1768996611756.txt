Replit Prompt — Global Cinematic Theme Transition (DO NOT TOUCH SWITCH)
⚠️ IMPORTANT

DO NOT modify the existing theme switch

DO NOT change its animation

DO NOT change its design

Treat the switch as a trigger only

Your task is to add a global, page-wide animation layer that reacts to the switch.

🎯 Objective

Create a full-page cinematic theme transition that visually spreads across the entire screen when dark mode is toggled, while preserving the current switch animation exactly as-is.

The effect should feel like:

Darkness (or light) flows across the interface, not snaps.

🧱 Architectural Approach (MANDATORY)
Add a Global Transition Overlay

A fixed-position element:

<div id="theme-transition-layer" />


Positioned:

position: fixed;
inset: 0;
pointer-events: none;
z-index: 9999;


This layer:

Animates ONCE per toggle

Disappears after animation completes

Does NOT interfere with layout or clicks

🌊 Animation Behavior (CORE EXPERIENCE)
When switching Light → Dark:

1️⃣ Darkness emanates from the switch origin

Use:

radial-gradient mask

or clip-path circle

Origin point = switch button position (x, y)

2️⃣ The dark tone:

Expands smoothly

Covers entire viewport

Slight vignette near edges

No harsh edges

3️⃣ Background colors underneath:

Transition naturally while masked

No flicker

No repaint artifacts

When switching Dark → Light:

Reverse the effect:

Soft light expands

Darkness retreats

Slight glow effect

Feels like “morning light”, not flashlight

🎞️ Motion & Timing Rules

Duration: 600–900ms

Use:

ease-in-out

cubic-bezier

or spring physics

Animation must feel:

calm

expensive

intentional

No instant jumps. No linear easing.

🎨 Visual Style

No particles

No sparks

No gimmicks

No blur overload

Allowed:

Subtle noise/grain (optional)

Very soft gradients

Ambient shadow fade

🧠 UX Constraints

Animation runs only when user toggles

Does NOT re-run on:

route change

page reload

Respects prefers-reduced-motion

If enabled → instant switch (no animation)

🛠️ Technical Constraints

React 18

Tailwind CSS

CSS variables for themes

Optional:

Framer Motion (recommended)

Pure CSS fallback

Theme state must already exist — just listen to it.

🧪 Edge Cases

Works on large screens & mobile

No performance drop

No scroll lock

No white flash

No hydration mismatch

🚫 HARD NOs

❌ Modifying the switch

❌ Replacing the switch

❌ Using default Tailwind transitions

❌ Full opacity fade (cheap look)

❌ Screen flicker

✅ Acceptance Criteria

This is DONE only if:

The switch still feels perfect

The page feels “alive” during theme change

Users feel the transition, not notice the technique

The app feels premium SaaS / Apple-level

🧠 Design Philosophy

The switch starts the story.
The screen finishes it.
